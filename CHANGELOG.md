## Technical Details

### Game State Machine
The game now properly manages these states:
1. `lobby` - Players join with avatars
2. `category_selection` - Random player chooses category
3. `question_reading` - Question displayed (10s)
4. `lie_submission` - Players submit lies (30s)
5. `option_selection` - Players vote (30s)
6. `truth_reveal` - Scoring revealed
7. `scoreboard` - Results shown

### WebSocket Events
Key events for real-time communication:
- `join_game` → `player_joined_response`
- `submit_lie` → `lie_submitted`
- `select_option` → `option_selected`
- `game_state_update` (broadcast)
- `sub_step_info` (player-specific)
